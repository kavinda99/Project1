                Intrepid offers a wide range of Family Adventures around the globe. The minimum age (for Family trips) varies depending
                on destination, and Intrepid has set minimum ages to ensure that the included activities suit each age range.
                Additionally, you’ll notice that some of the more adventurous destinations have a higher minimum age. Please view our
                family adventures for more information. </p>

            <div class="answers">
                <p>Intrepid is committed to making travel widely accessible, regardless of ability or disability. We ask that you carefully
                consider whether you are physically and mentally able to complete the itinerary you have chosen, recognising that on
                many trips you will be required to carry your own bags and use public transport.<p>
                
                <p>Where we can we will make reasonable adjustments to the operation of our trips to facilitate the requirements of
                disabled travellers – such as booking ground floor accommodation, or having our leaders communicate important directions
                in writing as well as verbally. Many travellers with disabilities have been able to enjoy our trips by travelling with a
                friend or companion who can assist with specific needs. If joining a group trip is not practical we may be able to
                provide you with a private departure. Please contact our sales team for further information on any of our itineraries. </p>

                Safety and medical information
            </label>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>I am concerned about the political stability of the country through which my trip will travel.
                The safety of our passengers, leaders and operators is a major priority for Intrepid. With this in mind, we monitor
                world events very closely and Intrepid makes operational decisions based on informed advice from a number of sources, in
                particular the level of the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT) travel advisory. If this
                advisory is at Level 4 'Do Not Travel' then Intrepid will either cancel the Intrepid Travel operated trip or reroute the
                itinerary to avoid the areas concerned. Visit intrepidtravel.com/contact-us/safety for further details.
                
                How safe are my belongings whilst on the trip?
                While we take all the precautions we can to make sure your belongings are safe, we are travelling to some exciting
                destinations that are sometimes home to some pretty skilled thieves. Travel insurance is a must and a lockable bag or
                money belt will always help too.
                
                What is the best way to carry money?
                We recommend having access to money from a variety of sources – cash, cards and travel money cards are all commonly
                used. Check your Essential Trip Information and the relevant Destination Page on our website for more country-specific
                information.
                
                Will refrigeration be available for medicines? eg. Insulin
                Availability of refrigeration cannot be guaranteed. As a general rule, many of our city hotels provide access to small
                fridges; however, outside of this, especially when trekking or in homestay environments, you cannot rely on access to
                refrigeration. Please be sure to advise Intrepid if you are travelling with medication that requires refrigeration.
                
                What are the medical and vaccination requirements?
                Medical and vaccination requirements differ between nations and as we are not medical practitioners, we unfortunately
                cannot advise on this issue. Please see your local GP or travel doctor for details and advice about current vaccination
                requirements.
                
                What if I get ill or injured on the trip and unable to continue?
                Our leaders are trained to deal with these situations and we will endeavour to get you help as quickly as possible. If
                you must leave the trip early due to illness, our local offices will help you find appropriate medical care and ensure
                someone at home is aware of the situation. We will do whatever we can to get you home or on your onward journey. Your
                travel insurance, which is compulsory on all our trips, should cover any costs incurred if illness occurs. </p>

                <p>A travel agent takes all of the headache out of planning a trip and handles virtually all aspects of your travel, at absolutely no cost to you. The combined experience of the team and the feedback from our thousands of travelers provides an invaluable resource to the traveler planning an important trip.

                <p>Sri Lanka culture is predominately Buddhist, meaning that the country is very welcoming and safe for women travelling
                alone. ... It is a wonderful country to explore independently but if you are unsure what to see in Sri Lanka, you may
                feel more comfortable in a group tour for your Sri Lanka holidays.</p>
